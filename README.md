This contains the MCreator workspace where you can access my mods.

I used several generators from the offical MCreator website, and installed many versions of MCreator for each version and manunally made the mods.

You can build the mods using these workspaces or install them at..

https://modrinth.com/mod/chainable-pickaxes
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chainable-pickaxes

Refactor these workspaces for other versions.
